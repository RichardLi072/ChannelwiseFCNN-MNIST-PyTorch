# ChannelwiseFCNN-MNIST-PyTorch
Since couldn't find an ideal example of a channelwise fully connected layer online, I handcrafted one using PyTorch with the MNIST dataset. The purpose of this project is to construct a viable channelwise fully connected layer, rather than to efficiently solve the MNIST problem.
